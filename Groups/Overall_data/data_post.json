By integrating digital and flexo technologies into one workflow, label converters can enhance their capabilities, reduce waste and improve efficiency.\nBOBST launched the DIGITAL MASTER series in April 2022, underpinning its vision for the future of label production. This new family of All-in-One, All-Inline solutions, which is available in 340 and 510 mm print widths, combines digital and analogue technologies in a single press. Based on a fully modular and upgradable architecture, this enables customers to build a press that fulfils their current and future needs.\nFrom simple pressure-sensitive to multi-layer and high-value embellished labels, the DIGITAL MASTER 340 and DIGITAL MASTER 510 provide converters with the high flexibility needed to maximize their productivity and adapt their production floor as well as cope with manpower shortages and substrates management.\n\u201cAt BOBST, we understand that every customer has unique requirements, which is why we have developed the unique DIGITAL MASTER series platform. Now, converters can experience the modularity and versatility of DIGITAL MASTER series with the new 3D CONFIGURATOR, which enables them to configure their press based on their specific requirements,\u201d said Patrick Graber \u2013 Strategic Marketing Manager.\nWith BOBST\u2019s new 3D CONFIGURATOR, converters are given instant online access to view all possible modules \u2013 including flexo, delam/relam, multi-layer, combo coupon, hot foil, combo lamination, screen-printing, and semi-rotary and rotary die-cutting \u2013 which can be added, arranged, combined or removed from the base machine according to their current job basket. Each module is visualized in 3D with descriptions detailing their use and potential.\nOnce the configuration has been finalized, a full report with the details including press dimensions, will be presented.

What started as a labor relations and HR consulting firm has grown to offer solutions for many of the challenges that employers face today.\nSpooner\u2019s journey into workers\u2019 compensation started in 1981, when a client asked Tom to attend an Industrial Commission hearing on behalf of their company. The client felt they\u2019d paid more than enough for this particular workers\u2019 comp claim, but the Hearing Officer didn\u2019t consider that a valid argument. However, the Hearing Officer suggested that Tom read the Ohio Revised Code Workers\u2019 Compensation book, since it was clear he truly wanted to protect and help the businesses he works with. Nearly 50 years later, that remains the goal of every company under the Spooner umbrella. In 2017, Tom\u2019s grandson Joe Spooner stepped into the role of president to ensure the company\u2019s values continue to align with those ideals.\nSITE: https://spoonerinc.com\nADDRESS\n28605 Ranney Parkway\nWestlake, Ohio 44145\nPhone: 440-249-5260 ext. 153",

        "data_description": "The Spooner Risk Control family of companies was established in 1975, when Tom Spooner uprooted his youngest son from his bedroom so it could be turned into an office. What started as a labor relations and HR consulting firm has grown to offer solutions for many of the challenges that employers face today.\nSpooner\u2019s journey into workers\u2019 compensation started in 1981, when a client asked Tom to attend an Industrial Commission hearing on behalf of their company. The client felt they\u2019d paid more than enough for this particular workers\u2019 comp claim, but the Hearing Officer didn\u2019t consider that a valid argument. However, the Hearing Officer suggested that Tom read the Ohio Revised Code Workers\u2019 Compensation book, since it was clear he truly wanted to protect and help the businesses he works with. Nearly 50 years later, that remains the goal of every company under the Spooner umbrella. In 2017, Tom\u2019s grandson Joe Spooner stepped into the role of president to ensure the company\u2019s values continue to align with those ideals.\nSITE: https://spoonerinc.com\nADDRESS\n28605 Ranney Parkway\nWestlake, Ohio 44145\nPhone: 440-249-5260 ext. 153",
